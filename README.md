# GBSprite

A super simple sprite/tile editor for the GameBoy, made using Love2d. The editor is very basic and made to be used mainly by me.

Use the scroll wheel to select color (0-3).

Mouse click draws pixel.

Esc exits program (with y/n confirmation).

Upon exit, the program will print out an array of bytes in hexadecimal representing the sprite, that can be copied and placed in a GameBoy program.
